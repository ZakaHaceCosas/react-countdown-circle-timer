# React Native Countdown Timer

A React Native countdown timer component in a circle shape with color and progress animation. Originally made by [Vasil Dimitrov](https://github.com/vydimitrov), this is a fork to update it to the latest version of React Native. [His version](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-countdown-circle-timer/tree/master) also supports standard React, by the way.
